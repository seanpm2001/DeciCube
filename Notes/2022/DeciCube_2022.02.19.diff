++ The big responsibility: DO NOT FILL THE DECICUBE, Don't purposefully write software to fit inside as much of the cube as possible, including but not limited to: Creating Call of Duty (hundreds of gigabytes) releasing 24000+ releases of a programming language like Swift, making operating systems that use up 32+ gigabytes of space when much less is truly needed. Each individual entry counts, and we have to make sure the DeciCube lasts as long as possible.
++ Research regarding condensed physics needed
