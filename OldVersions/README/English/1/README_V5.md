# The DeciCube

**Short for:** `The "Decillion cube"`

**Proposed by:** `Sean Patrick Myrick (@seanpm2001)` **on:** `2022, Thursday, January 27th at 22:25:28 (10:25:28 pm PST)`

**Last revised on:** `2022, Monday, February 21st at 12:40 am`

_A computer that can hold at least 1 billion copies of the entire Internet (as of 2022, Thursday, January 27th) and fit inside a single datacenter, or a single 3 meter by 3 meter brick (expanded to a 30 meter by 30 meter brick, and possibly also to a 300 meter by 300 meter brick, or a 3 kilometer by 3 kilometer brick, due to logical and theoretical limitations)_

## Statistics

**Estimated cost:** `at least $1b USD` **or:** `at least $1t USD` _(calculated with 2021 December 31st inflation levels)_

**Compatible file systems:** `ZFS`, `openZFS` _(compatible file systems must be 128 bit or higher)_

**System type:** `Quantum computer mass/ultra storage-based device`

**Size:** | **somewhere between:** `3x3x0.5 meters`, **and** `3x3x0.5 kilometers` _(An actual cube would be too tall, it is more of a slab)_

**Compatible operating systems:** `Linux`, `UNIX-like`, `other ZFS/OpenZFS-compatible operating systems` _(All current and past versions of Windows are not compatible as of 2022 Saturday, February 5th) [#1](#Ref1)

**Storage capacity:** `~500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (~500 Nonillion bytes, or ~500.00 geopbytes)`

**Processor type:** `128x, 256x128`

**Operating system:** `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and later` `Fedora 36 and later` `Arch Linux 2022.01.* and later` `Oracle Solaris` `Any other operating system that is fully compatible with a 128 bit or 256 bit file system`

**Pairs well with:** [CompuBunker](https://github.com/CompuBunker/) /  [Compunker](https://github.com/Compunker/)

## Manufacturers

None yet. This idea needs a lot more research before it can start being manufacturered, and it will be very expensive to make.

## Power source

Research is needed into the power consumption and demands of this project. The device will not be portable as in the sense of someone picking it up with their hands, and it will not include its own battery in the DCube structure, but may have a separate battery cube attachment.

## Portability

This device is expected to be extremely heavy (weighing over 1 gigaton, or 1,000,000,000 tons) and it is currently unknown how it will be moved around.

### DCube structure

The DCube structure is the concept of the building blocks of the hardware structure. DBlocks are blocks ranging from 3 inch to 3 inch bricks to a bigger size (not yet determined)

The main structure is called the DCube. Components connecting to the device are known just as components (such as a power source)

### USB

I don't know how to support USB yet. The transfer to and from the DeciCube is currently needing work.

### As a max storage device

Since this technology works at the technological/theoretical limits, it is known as a max storage device. However, if we somehow end up discovering matter smaller than what we know makes up an atom and can work with it, the term ultramax, or umax is still reserved for future use.

## Form factor

Assuming a Silicon atom is the only atom used, and that 1 silicon atom is equivalent to 111 picometers ([0.111 nanometers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=111+picometers+to+nanometers&t=ffab&ia=answer)) the form factor of the Decicube is 0.111 nanometers.

## As a quantum storage device

### Universal reponsibility

The big responsibility for the DeciCube is simply said: DO NOT FILL THE DECICUBE, Don't purposefully write software to fit inside as much of the cube as possible, including but not limited to: Creating Call of Duty (hundreds of gigabytes) releasing 24000+ releases of a programming language like Swift for every individual change (Apple has deleted it since then, but a year ago, it was all there, and it is likely in archive somewhere) making operating systems that use up 32+ gigabytes of space when much less is truly needed. Each individual entry counts, and we have to make sure the DeciCube lasts as long as possible. We can easily make the capacity last 250 years if we are just a little careful and considerate, but we should let it last over 600 years and not be careless.

## Grain of sand formula

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in a grain of sand (50 quintillion atoms)

* ~3.8461538461538463e+18 bits in a grain of sand

* 1 grain of sand = 1/1000 grams

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 gram (50 sextillion atoms)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) (50 septillion atoms)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 megagram (~1.102 tons) (50 octillion atoms)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 gigagram (~1.02 megatons) (50 nonillion atoms)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 teragram (~1.02 gigatons) (50 decillion atoms)

## Legend

* It is estimated that 1 bit of memory can fit into ~13 atoms of space, so a single byte (8 bits) can fit in ~104 atoms of space.

* 1 grain of sand is estimated to be 1/1000 of a gram, the largest size estimate of a grain of sand was used, as not all sand weighs the same.

* 1 b = 1 (one byte)

* 1 kb = 1k (one thousand bytes)

* 1 mb = 1m (one million bytes)

* 1 gb = 1b (one billion bytes)

* 1 tb = 1t (one trillion bytes)

* 1 pb = 1q (one quadrillion bytes)

* 1 exb = 1Q (one quintillion bytes)

* 1 zeb = 1s (one sextillion bytes)

* 1 yob = 1S (one septillion bytes)

* 1 bb = 1o (1,000 yottabytes, 1 brontobyte) (octillion)

* 1 gpb = 1n (1,000,000 yottabytes, 1 geopbyte) (nonillion)

* 1,000 gpb = 1d (1,000,000,000 yottabytes, 1,000 geopbytes) (decillion)

* Gigagram is a metric term I coined that adds computer analogy to expand the metric system. It is equal to 1,000 kilograms

* 1 Teragram is also a metric term I coined. It is equal to 1,000 gigagrams.

* The term "gigaton" may not have previously existed, but is defined here as being equivalent to 1,000 megatons.

* See all my improvement proposals to the Metric System at [https://github.com/seanpm2001/Metric-System/tree/main/Improvements/Meters/SI_Meters](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Metric-System/tree/main/Improvements/Meters/SI_Meters)

## Concerns

Due to its size and density, hardware failure is a major concern, as the device cannot be easily replaced. Even though it may cost billions or even trillions just to build 1 DeciCube, it is recommended to construct at least 3 of them, as part of the 1-2-3 rule of software backups.

"NTFS can support volumes as large as 8 petabytes on Windows Server 2019 and newer and Windows 10, version 1709 and newer (older versions support up to 256 TB)"

The DeciCube holds far more than 8 petabytes, and is simply not compatible for this reason. OpenZFS and ZFS are currently the only options for this hardware concept.
